# Book list

I like books.  For a career, they have an absurdly good price-to-value ratio:
pay something like $20 for a book and you'll get distilled information from
hundreds of hours of an experienced person.  Even if you were able to take them
out to lunch, it'd cost more.  The returns into your salary are on such a
different scale than the money you paid that we can't even compare them; really
the primary cost is the time spent reading and absorbing.  Books are great.

I often hear questions from other engineers that fall into categories of
questions other people have asked previously.  Not surprisingly, common
questions tend to have books written to address them.  Thus, I find myself
providing recommendations to the same books over and over again, and rather
than dig them out of my brain or Amazon list every time, I've decided to list
them here.

Some of these books I've read and can recommend directly.  Many I have not yet
read, but they have come recommended via sources I trust enough to have them be
on my own to-read list.  This is not necessarily a "great books!" list, then,
but rather a recording of research that I have done myself to find resources.

## Goal-Setting / Time Management

- [Outcomes Over Output](http://amazon.com/Outcomes-Over-Output-customer-behavior-ebook/dp/B07QJ1Y8Y5/)
  * A short book, mostly an introduction to the idea of focusing on results rather than how much effort we put into a project.  There are some examples of how to do this, but if you're doing it for real I think you'll want another book to help you out there; this is mostly useful to help convince change.
- [Radical Focus](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Focus-SECOND-Achieving-Objectives-ebook/dp/B091ZL2SRL/)
  * OKRs.  I don't remember why people recommended this over Measure What Matters, High Output Management, and similar, but there were convincing reasons.
